/**
 * Simple Example *
 * This is a minimal demo page for the NuCaptcha Leap Marketing Client. Both transaction creation and validation are demoed in this script.
 *
 * There are 3 distinct actions/steps performed by a publisher website:
 * 1. NuCaptcha transaction initialization
 * 2. Display of NuCaptcha widget on web page
 * 3. Validation of user input to NuCaptcha widget
 *
 * The example code below does both transaction initialization, display of the widget to the user, and validation.
 *
 * In order for that to work, validation (step 3) is actually done first.

/*
 * Step 3:
 * Validate the previous transaction, if need be. Do this first, so that we can use the same code/page to validate and initialize a transaction.
