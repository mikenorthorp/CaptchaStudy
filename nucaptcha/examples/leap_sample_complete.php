/**
 * Complete Example *
 * This is a through example of the NuCaptcha Leap Marketing Client. Transaction creation, validation, and error checking are demoed in this script.
 *
 * There are 3 distinct actions/steps performed by a publisher website:
 * 1. NuCaptcha transaction initialization
 * 2. Display of NuCaptcha widget on web page
 * 3. Validation of user input to NuCaptcha widget
 *
 * The example code below does both transaction initialization, display of the widget to the user, and validation.
 *
 * In order for that to work, validation (step 3) is actually done first.
 *

/*
 * General Setup
 */
// Include the Leap Client library
require_once("./../leapmarketingclient.php");

// Your ClientKey is supplied by Leap and can be downloaded from the publisher dashboard
Leap::SetClientKey("YOUR_CLIENT_KEY_HERE");

// The session is used in this example to store persistent data on the server
session_start();
// Default some variables for substitution into the HTML output
$transaction_status = "New Transaction";
$player_output      = "";
/*
 * Step 3:
 * Validate the previous transaction, if need be. Do this first, so that we can use the same code/page to validate and initialize a transaction.
 */
// Check if the persistent data was stored, and if the user actually submitted an answer
if(true === array_key_exists('leap', $_SESSION) && true === Leap::WasSubmitted())
{
    // validate the transaction
    $valid = Leap::ValidateTransaction($_SESSION['leap']);

	// check for error
	// by default, ValidateTransaction will return true on error
	if( Leap::GetStatusCode() != LMSC_CORRECT &&
		Leap::GetStatusCode() != LMSC_WRONG &&
		Leap::GetStatusCode() != LMSC_EMPTY )
	{
		// log the error somewhere so we know it happened
		error_log(
			'Error Code: ' . Leap::GetStatusCode() .
			' Error Message: ' . Leap::GetStatusString()
		);
	}

    // check the result
    if (true === $valid)
    {
		// We have a valid captcha
		$transaction_status = "Answer was correct.";

        // This is where you'd most likely redirect to the next page, or submit the results
        // of what you were trying to validate (forum post, picture submission, etc)
    }
    else
	{
		$transaction_status = "Answer was incorrect";
	}
}
/*
 * Step 1:
 * Start a new transaction
 */
// initialize the transaction
$t = Leap::InitializeTransaction();

// check if the transaction initialization was successful
if(LMSC_OK !== Leap::GetStatusCode())
{
	// log the error somewhere so we know it happened.
	// we don't have to worry about showing the error to the user since
	// Leap::ValidateOnError is enabled by default.
	error_log("Getting Transaction failed: " . Leap::GetStatusString());
}

// store the persistent data in the session for validation later
// This should NEVER be sent to the client
$_SESSION['leap'] = $t->GetPersistentData();

// and get the actual player code
$player_output = $t->GetWidget();

/*
 * Step 2:
 * Display the NuCaptcha widget/HTML.
