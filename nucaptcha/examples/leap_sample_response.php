/**
 * NuCaptcha Example Script
 *
 * This example of the NuCaptcha Leap Marketing Client explains how to use the lmcResponse object. You would use this object directly if your $_POST
 * variables get mangled before you get them (which happens when you use certain php frameworks).
 *
 * There are 3 distinct actions/steps performed by a publisher website:
 *
 * 1. NuCaptcha transaction initialization
 * 2. Display of NuCaptcha widget on web page
 * 3. Validation of user input to NuCaptcha widget
 *
 * The example code below does both transaction initialization, display of the widget to the user, and validation.
 * In order for that to work, validation (step 3) is actually done first
 *
 * The use of the lmcResponse object is demonstrated in the code under Step3.5 below.
 * The code below Step 3.5, as well as the name mangling of the $_POST array at the beginning of this
 * file, are the only differences between this example and the complete example (leap_sample_complete.php).
 *
 * Note also that if the $_POST array is mangled, Leap::WasSubmitted() will not work properly
 *
